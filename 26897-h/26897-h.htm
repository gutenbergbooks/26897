<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>LATIN DRINKING SONG BY RICHARD BRAITHWAIT.</h3>

  <p>I have been surprised, from the facility with which the author of
  "Drunken Barnaby" seems to pour out his Leonine verse, that no other
  productions of a similar character are known to have issued from his pen.
  I am not aware that the following drinking song, which may fairly be
  attributed to him, has ever appeared in print. It was evidently unknown
  to the worthy Haslewood, the crowning glory of whose literary career was
  the happy discovery of the author, Richard Braithwait. I transcribe it
  from the MS. volume from which James Boswell first gave to the world
  Shakspeare's verses "On the King." Southey has somewhere said that "the
  best serious piece of Latin in modern metre is Sir Francis Kinaston's
  <i>Amores Troili et Cressidæ</i>, a translation of the two first books of
  Chaucer's Poem<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; but it was reserved for
  <i>famous</i> <span class="sc">Barnaby</span> to employ the barbarous
  ornament of rhyme, so as to give thereby point and character to good
  Latinity."</p>

  <p>Southey does not seem to have known those remarkable productions of
  the middle ages, which have been made accessible to us by the researches
  of Docen, of Grimm, of Schmeller, and of Mr. Wright; and, above all, of
  that exquisite gem, "De Phyllide et Flora," first printed by Docen<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, and since given
  by Mr. Wright in his collection of <i>Poems attributed to Walter de
  Mapes</i>. We have, however, a much better text from the hand of Jacob
  Grimm, in the <i>Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin for 1843</i>, p. 239.
  Of this poem it is perhaps not exaggeration to say, that it is an Idyll
  which would have done honour to the literature of any age or country; and
  if it is the production of Walter de Mapes, we have reason to be proud of
  it. It is a dispute between two maidens on the qualities of their lovers,
  the one being a soldier, the other a priest. It breathes of the spring,
  of nature, and of love:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Erant ambæ virgines et ambæ reginæ</p>
      <p>Phyllis coma libera Flora comto crine,</p>
      <p>Non sunt formæ virginum sed formæ divinæ,</p>
      <p>Et respondent facies luci matutinæ.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nec stirpe, nec facie, nec ornatu viles,</p>
      <p>Et annos et animos habent juveniles</p>
      <p>Sed sunt parum inpares, et parum hostiles</p>
      <p>Nam hinc placet clericus illi vero miles."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>{298}</span></p>

  <p>Love is called in to decide the dispute, and it causes no surprise to
  find, after due ventilation of the cause, the judgment of the court to
  be:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Secundum scientiam et secundum morem,</p>
      <p><span class="sc">Ad amorem clericum dicunt aptiorem</span>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Your readers who are not already acquainted with this interesting
  picture of ancient manners will, I think, be pleased with having it
  pointed out to their notice.</p>

  <p>Should the following song not be already in print, I can also furnish
  from the same source a version of the ballad on "Robin Goodfellow" by the
  same hand, should it be acceptable.<a name="footnotetag3"

<h3>STRANGE APPEARANCES IN THE SKY.</h3>

  <p>Strange appearances in the sky have not been without their ominous
  signification from the time that the greater and lesser lights were
  placed there at the creation, to the rainbow after the Deluge; and onward
  to the "star in the east" which announced our Saviour's birth, and the
  "light from heaven" which accompanied St. Paul's conversion. But the
  question is, whether there has since been any meaning in other like
  celestial illuminations? Some historical credit is claimed for the fiery
  sword, and armies fighting in the air, which preceded the siege of
  Jerusalem: for the cross of the Emperor Constantine: for the bow about
  the sun seen by Augustus Cæsar, when he took possession of the Roman
  empire: and for stars, or other heavenly lights, which have seemed to
  herald the births or deaths of illustrious personages. But are these
  stories to be believed? and, if they are, where is the line of
  credibility to be drawn? People cannot come together, and talk either on
  this subject, or on that of ghosts, but every one "hath a revelation,
  hath an interpretation." The poet, walking on the mountains, looked into
  the sky, and</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The appearance, instantaneously disclosed,</p>
      <p>Was of a mighty city&mdash;boldly say</p>
      <p>A wilderness of building, sinking far,</p>
      <p>And self-withdrawn, into a wondrous depth,</p>
      <p>Far sinking into splendour&mdash;without end?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The two following extracts are from private letters now before me. The
  first account was written in 1825 by a physician, still alive, and <!--
  Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>{299}</span>who
  at the time read an account of what he had seen at a meeting of the
  Plinian Society. He says,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I last evening read a paper upon an extraordinary appearance of
  letters, formed by the clouds, seen by a Mr. T. and myself. We had also
  with us two little boys, one nine, the other eleven years of age, who
  were able to make out each letter equally with ourselves. These children
  were at the time walking some distance behind us: but, upon their coming
  up, and being shown the letters, they read them without having heard any
  observation of ours respecting them. We saw them for about two minutes,
  when they gradually changed their form&mdash;each letter changing its
  perpendicular for a horizontal position, and at length the whole becoming
  converted into that form of cloud denominated cirro-stratus. I will
  endeavour to give you a faint idea of the appearance, by forming the
  letters as well as my memory will enable me. I make no comment upon the
  words themselves, as they are too extraordinary for observation of any
  kind. It was upon the 12th of last month: several showers had fallen in
  the course of the day, but the afternoon was fine. The time seven in the
  evening. The letters were formed upon a fine blue surface, having no
  other clouds near them, except very small ones, which tended much to
  heighten the effect of the whole.</p>

  <p>"You will observe several deficiencies in the letters of the first
  word, viz. in the first 'E;' also in the 'N,' the second part being
  short; and a slight defect in the letter 'A.' With respect to the second
  word, the first six letters were very perfect: the others, with the
  exception of the 'M,' mere strokes; but in number sufficient to make up
  the word: and they had the appearance of having been perfect. I can
  assure you they were anything but obscure, and required very little
  stretch of the imagination. In the first word the letters were
  equidistant and beautifully uniform. The second word was not quite
  straight, being curved towards its termination. This appeared to me to
  arise from the change of position which the letters were undergoing, as
  before stated."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My other extract is from a letter written in 1851. The scene to which
  it refers is a sick chamber occupied by an octogenarian grandmother, who
  is <i>in extremis</i>. Her daughter, who writes the account, is present,
  together with a grandchild, who is nearly eleven years old. The nurse has
  left the room.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We afterwards stood by poor grandmamma's fire, and then we sat at her
  window to see the moon rise. There were many clouds about it, and
  directly under it was the most marked figure of our Saviour on the cross.
  The head was concealed in light, but the arms were outstretched, and the
  body quite distinct. M. saw it too, and said, 'How appropriate, aunt, for
  the beginning of Lent!' She has never alluded to it since, nor, of
  course, have I; nor do I think any more of it, than that <i>there it
  was</i>: and there is something happy in the fancy, at all events, for it
  shone on her dying bed."</p>

<h3>"AFTER ME THE DELUGE."</h3>

  <p>If stolen wisdom could be returned to its rightful authors, great,
  indeed, would be the transfer of property. Prince Metternich is said to
  be the sayer of "After me the Deluge." And yet the Prince took the saying
  from the mouth of Madame Pompadour; and she took it&mdash;from whom? It
  may be reasonably doubted that her brain originated it; for it was not an
  order of brain that packs wisdom in few syllables.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'After me the Deluge,' said Prince Metternich; a fine saying, but a
  false prophecy we trust."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I quote this from an admirable paper in <i>The Times</i> of to-day
  (April 10.) on the Crystal Palace, and quote the subscribed from an
  <i>Essai sur la Marquise de Pompadour</i>, prefixed to the <i>Mémoires de
  Madame du Hausset, Femme de Chambre de Madame Pompadour</i>, in
  Barrière's <i>Bibliothèque des Mémoires</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Madame de Pompadour, dans l'ivresse de la prospérité, répondit à
  toutes les menaces de l'avenir par ces trois [<i>quatre</i>] mots, "<span
  class="sc">Après nous, le Déluge</span>," qu'elle répétait souvent."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this case, "Pompadour <i>v.</i> Metternich," surely a verdict must
  be returned for the lady, unless Voltaire puts in a future claim.</p>

<h3>BISHOP THORNBOROUGH'S MONUMENT.</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The writer of the following interesting communication does not appear
  to be aware that he is obliging us and a correspondent D.&nbsp;Y., who had
  asked (Vol. iii., p. 168.) for an explanation of the phrase <i>Denarius
  Philosophorum</i>, in the Bishop's Monument.]</p>

</div>

  <p>Our local antiquaries have long been puzzled by an inscription in the
  Lady chapel of our cathedral. It stands on the monument of Bishop
  Thornborough, and was prepared by himself fourteen years before his
  decease in 1641, at the age of ninety-four. He was addicted to alchymy,
  and published a book in 1621, entitled <span title="Lithotheôrikos" class="grk"
  >&Lambda;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&theta;&epsilon;&omega;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>sive</i>, <i>Nihil aliquid</i>, <i>omnia</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> In the
  course of some recent studies in the Pythagorean philosophy, my attention
  was accidentally engaged by this <!-- Page 300 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>{300}</span>inscription; and it at
  once struck me that it was <i>thence</i> that the explanation was to be
  derived. The epitaph is as follows: on one side,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Denarius Philosophorum, Dum Spiro, Spero."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>on the other,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Uno, 2<sup>o</sup>. 3<sup>o</sup>. 4<sup>or</sup> 10. non Spirans
  Spera<i>bo</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The latter letters are now effaced.</p>

  <p>It is well known that the Pythagoreans found all the modes of space in
  the relations of numbers.</p>

  <p>The monad, or unit, was not only the <i>point</i> whence all extension
  proceeds, but it further symbolised the First Principle, the origin of
  all. The <span class="correction" title="Original reads `decad', making no sense in view of what follows. Duad (more likely to be misread than dyad) seems correct."
  >duad</span> represented the line, as being bounded by two points or
  monads. The triad stood for surface as length and width. The tetrad for
  the perfect figure, the cube, length, depth, and width. The decad, or
  denarius, indicated comprehensively all being, material and immaterial,
  in the utmost perfection: hence the term <i>decas</i>, or
  <i>denarius</i>, was used summarily for the whole science of numbers, as
  in the title of Meursius's tract <i>De Denario Pythagorico</i>, which was
  published four years after the date of the inscription, and when the
  philosophy was attracting much attention among European scholars. To be
  as concise as possible then, I presume that the old bishop intended that
  the tomb on which his effigy lies was his access to that perfection of
  existence which philosophers had designated by the <i>decas</i>, or
  <i>denarius</i>. During the present life he was hoping for it, "Dum
  Spiro, Spero."&mdash;On the other side: "In Him, who is the source, the
  beginning, the middle, and the end of all existence and perfection (in
  Uno, 2<sup>o</sup>. 3<sup>o</sup>. 4<sup>or</sup> 10. non Spirans
  Sperabo), though I breathe no more, yet shall I hope."</p>

  <p>Such is probably the meaning of his pious conceit, and I offer it as a
  solution of what has long served for a riddle to the visitors of our
  cathedral. Beyond this, your readers and myself may be equally
  indifferent to such cabalistical quaintness. But let us treat it with
  charity, as the devout consummation of an aged alchymist.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>King Richard III.</i> (Vol. iii., p. 221.).&mdash;On the 14th May,
  1491 (6 Henry VII.), one Master William Burton, the schoolmaster of St.
  Leonard's Hospital, in the city of York, was accused before the
  magistrates of having said that "King Richard was an hypocrite, a
  <i>crocheback</i>, and buried in a dike like a dog." This circumstance is
  recorded in a contemporary document of unquestionable authenticity (vide
  extracts from <i>York Records in the Fifteenth Century</i>, p. 220.); and
  must remove all doubt as to the fact of Richard's bodily deformity. The
  conjecture of Dr. Wallis, quoted by G.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;G., can have no weight when
  opposed by clear evidence that the word "crouchback," as a term of
  reproach or contempt, was applied to King Richard within a few years
  after his death, by one to whom his person must have been familiarly
  known.</p>

  <p>In a "fore and aft sail" of the present day, the "shoulder" is the
  <i>foremost upper</i> corner, and the <i>last part of the canvass</i> on
  which the wind fixes its influence when a vessel is "sailing by the
  wind," or even "off the wind." The "veriest lout" in the "after-guard"

  <p><i>Early Instances of the World "News."</i>&mdash;Without the
  slightest intention of re-opening the discussion as to whether the word
  "newes" be of native growth or imported, I would beg leave to suggest as
  a means of completing <i>its history</i>, that should any of the readers
  of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," whose researches may lead
  amongst the authorities of the <i>fifteenth</i> century, meet with
  instances of the word in familiar use between <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1400 and <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1500,
  they would notify the same.</p>

  <p>The earliest date of its colloquial use as yet recorded in "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," is <span class="scac">A.D.</span>
  1513: on the other hand, the word, so far as I am aware, is nowhere used
  by Chaucer, although his near approach to it in the following lines is
  very remarkable:</p>

  <div class="poem">

    </div>

  <p>After this, the transition to the word itself is so extremely easy,
  that it could not be far distant.</p>

  <p><i>Under the Rose.</i>&mdash;It may interest the inquirers into the
  origin of this expression to know, that at Lullingston Castle in Kent,
  the residence of Sir Percival Dyke, there is in the hall an old picture,

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>PORTRAITS OF SPENSER.</h3>

  <p>The engraved portraits of Spenser differ so much from each other as to
  throw doubts on their resemblance to the poet.</p>

  <p>I have now before me the following:</p>

  <p>1. That prefixed to Bell's edition, 1777, engraved by Cook from "an
  original in Lord Chesterfield's collection."</p>

  <p>2. Prefixed to an edition in one volume published by Spiers, 1840.</p>

  <p>3. Prefixed to Moxon's edition, 1845.</p>

  <p>We are not told from what paintings Nos. 2. and 3. are engraved, but
  they resemble each other, and are somewhat like that in Bell's edition;
  so I shall set these three down as forming one class of portraits. No. 2.
  has, however, a curious inscription, <i>Edmund Spenser</i>, <i>obiit
  1559</i>, which would lead us to reject it altogether, and look on it as
  an imaginary likeness.</p>

  <p>4. The portrait in Pickering's Aldine edition, 1839: this bears no
  resemblance, either in costume or features, to those already mentioned;
  but, if I mistake not, is like that in Todd's edition, published in
  1805,&mdash;we may call these a second class.</p>

  <p>An original portrait of Spenser is said to be in Lord Chesterfield's
  collection; another in Duplin Castle, the seat of Lord Kinnoul (of this
  there is a copy at Althorpe by Sir Henry Raeburn). Mr. Wright, in his
  <i>Memorials of Cambridge</i>, mentions a portrait at Pembroke College,
  "a copy by Wilson," but he does not say from what original: Mr. Craik, in
  <i>Spenser and his Writings</i>, speaks of <i>two</i> as being in this
  college.</p>

  <p>The writer thinks he recollects a law-suit relative to a portrait of
  the poet, which had been sold to the late Sir Robert Peel, and which was
  stated to have come from Ireland. Perhaps some of your readers could give
  information respecting this picture.</p>

  <p>It is clear, if the first three are all from the Chesterfield
  original, that this painting, and the one from which Mr. Pickering's is
  taken, cannot both be portraits of Spenser. The object of this Query is
  to ascertain, if possible, which engraving, or class of engravings,
  resembles the poet.</p>

<h3>THE VENDACE.</h3>

  <p>The very remarkable fish called the <i>Vendace</i> is to be found but
  in one place in the three kingdoms,&mdash;the Castle Loch of Lochmaben, a
  parish to the south of Dumfriesshire in Scotland. The Vendace, it is
  said, derives its name from <i>Vendois</i> in France, and was brought to
  this country by one of the James's. This, however, is mere conjecture,
  and, from its habits, highly improbable&mdash;because <i>they die the
  moment they are either touched or exposed to the air</i>.</p>

  <p>According to Mr. Stewart (<i>Elements of Natural Hist.</i>), the
  Vendace belongs to a species which he calls <i>Salmo albula</i>, or the
  "Juvangis."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This species," he adds, "is found in Lochmaben in Scotland, and
  <i>nowhere else</i>: it is said to have been carried thither from England
  in the time of Robert the Bruce."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Stewart describes the fish, but from his description it is evident
  he has never seen it. The following one is exact:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This beautiful fish measures from four to six inches in length, and
  tapers gradually to the tail. When taken out of the water, it has a
  bright silvery white appearance, with a slight tendency to a light blue
  along the back and part of the sides. In size it resembles a small
  herring or par, but particularly the former, not only in the mouth and
  external appearance, but also in the anatomical structure. <i>Upon the
  top of the head</i> there is a very distinct <i>shape of a heart</i>,
  covered with a transparent substance of a brownish colour, resembling a
  thin lamina of mica slate, <i>through which the brain is visible</i>.
  This peculiar mark proves it to be as yet a distinct and undescribed
  species. Nothing is ever found visible to the naked eye in the stomach of
  the Vendace. They are extremely delicate, and are allowed to be the most
  pleasing to the taste of all fish. The general mode of catching them is
  with a net, as there is no instance known of their having been caught
  either with bait or the artificial fly. The pike, with which this lake
  abounds, is their greatest enemy. It has been frequently stated that no
  fewer than fifteen distinct species of fish, fit for the table, have been
  found in the Castle Loch."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Knox, sometime Lecturer upon Anatomy in Edinburgh, states:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That he has not only discovered the food of the Vendace, but actually
  exhibited it before the Members of the Royal Society, and offers
  suggestions for the stocking of the various lakes in Britain with this
  exquisite fish; pointing out first the necessity of locating its natural
  food, without which it cannot live."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Allowing, however, that some neighbouring lake could be covered with
  some of these invisible and "incredibly minute entomostraceous animals,"
  which the learned lecturer says constitute their food, we should still
  find a difficulty in transferring the fish; as every attempt to do so,
  though conducted with the greatest possible care and nicety, <i>has
  failed</i>.</p>

  <p>In the preceding account, I have followed the Rev. John Gardiner of
  Lochmaben, who, in 1835, drew up an admirable account of his parish,
  which is inserted in the statistical survey of the county.</p>

  <p>The gentlemen of the county have formed a <!-- Page 302 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>{302}</span><i>Vendace Club</i>,
  which meets at Lochmaben annually on the 25th and 26th of July, when they
  dine off the fish. I asked one of the members how long it had been in
  existence, and he said about thirty years.</p>

  <p><i>Family of Queen Katherine Parr.</i>&mdash;The pedigree of the once

  works&mdash;Dugdale, Nicholls, Burke, &amp;c., is far from being complete
  or satisfactory. Could any one versed in the genealogy of the northern
  counties supply any information on the following points?&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. The early descent.&mdash;Dugdale in his <i>Baronage</i>, commences
  with Sir William Parr, who married Elizabeth De Ros, 1383; but he states
  the family to have been previously "of knightly degree." A MS. pedigree
  in the Herald's College also mentions Sir William as "descended from a
  race of knights." Where is an account of this race to be found?</p>

  <p>II. The separation between the two lines of Parr and Kendal.&mdash;Sir
  Thomas Parr, father of Queen Katherine, died 1518, and his <i>Inq. p.

  <p>Of course the general meaning of these two verses is obvious enough.
  But how is the latter to be read? Are we to read "dallies on," as one
  word, <i>i.e.</i> keeps dallying, and "skort" (as a mere abbreviation of
  the Latin "scortum") as nominative in apposition with "wife?" If so, the
  verse is intelligible, though harsh enough even for Hall.</p>

  <p>If not, the word "skort" must have some other meaning which I am
  unacquainted with. I cannot find it at all in Halliwell, the only

  <p>Cardinal Beaton had lots of bastards, but I never remember to have

  <p class="author">J. M.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The existence of a natural son of Cardinal Wolsey is a <i>fact</i> as
  well ascertained as any other <i>fact</i> of the Cardinal's history, and
  referred to in the various biographies of him that have appeared. His
  name was Thomas Winter. In Chalmers's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>,
  vol. xxxii. pp. 255. and 256. <i>note</i>, reference is made to a Bull of
  Pope Julius II., dated August, 1508, to be found in Kennet's MSS. in the
  British Museum, in which he is styled, "dilecti filio Thomæ Wulcy,"
  Rector of Lymington diocese of Bath and Wells, Master of Arts, "<i>pro
  dispensatione ad tertium incompatibile</i>." This is explained by the
  passage in Wood's <i>Athenæ Oxon. Fasti</i>, part i. p. 73. (Bliss ed.),
  relating to him. "This Tho. Winter, who was nephew (or rather nat. son)
  to Cardinal Tho. Wolsey, had several dignities confer'd upon him before
  he was of age, by the means of the said Cardinal," viz. the archedeaconry
  of York, 1523; chancellorship of the church of Sarum; the deanery of
  Wells, 1525; the provostship of Beverly; and the archdeaconry of
  Richmond, &amp;c.: on which there is a note by Baker, that "this Tho.
  Winter is said to have held of the church's goods clearly more than 2000
  pds. per an." Wood adds, that about the time of the Cardinal's fall, he
  gave up all or most of his dignities, keeping only the archdeaconry of
  York, which he resigned also in 1540. In Grove's <i>Life and Times of
  Cardinal Wolsey</i>, vol. iv. p. 315., among the "Articles" against the
  Cardinal, Article XXVII. expressly charges him, "that he took from his
  son Winter his income of 2,700<i>l.</i> a-year, applied it to his own
  use, and gave him only 200<i>l.</i> yearly to live on." A reference is
  made in Sir H. Ellis's <i>Letters Illustrative of English History</i>,
  2nd Series, vol. ii. p. 70., to a letter of Edmund Harvel to Dr. Starkey,
  dated from Venice, April 1535, in which the writer expresses his
  obligations to Mr. Winter, for his "friendly mynde toward him," and begs
  him to return his thanks.</p>

  <p>In Mr. Galt's <i>Life of Wolsey</i> (Appendix IV. p. 424. of Bogue's
  edition) will be found a copy of a letter from John Clusy to Cromwell, in
  relation to a natural daughter of Wolsey's in the nunnery of
  Shaftesbury.]</p>

  <p><i>Cardinals and Abbots in the English Church.</i>&mdash;It may not be
  generally known, but the fact is so, that the English church numbers two
  <span class="sc">Cardinals</span> and a <span class="sc">Lord
  Abbot</span> amongst her members. In Whitaker's <i>Clerical Diary</i>,
  under the head of London Diocese, there is attached to St. Paul's a
  senior and a junior cardinal; and in Ireland exists the exempt
  jurisdiction of Newry and Mourne, under the government of the Lord Abbot,
  who is the Earl of Kilmorey. Can any of your readers give me any
  information respecting these officials?</p>

  <p class="author">W. J.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[<i>Cardinal.</i>&mdash;The title of cardinal (<i>cardinalis</i>) in
  early times was frequently applied to any bishop, priest, or deacon
  holding an official post. In France there were many cardinal priests:
  thus, the curate of the parish of St. John de Vignes is called, in old
  charters, the cardinal priest of that parish. There were also cardinal
  deacons, who had the charge of hospitals for the poor, and who ranked
  above the other deacons. Thus, two of the minor canons of St. Paul's are
  called <i>cardinals of the choir</i>, whose duties are to preserve order
  in Divine service, administer the Eucharist, and officiate at funerals.
  In former times, they heard confessions and enjoined penances.
  (Newcourt's <i>Repertorium</i>, vol. i. p. 233.) It was not till the
  twelfth century that the Sacred College of Cardinals was organised; nor
  was it till 1567 that clergymen were forbidden by Pius V. to assume the
  title of cardinal unless appointed by the Pope.</p>

  <p><i>Lay Abbots.</i>&mdash;In early times we frequently find secular
  persons denominated "field abbots" and "abbot counts," upon whom the
  sovereign had bestowed certain abbeys, for which they were obliged to
  render military service, as for common fiefs. In the time of Charles the
  Bald many of the nobility in France were abbots, having a dean to
  officiate for them. Thus, too, in Scotland, James Stuart, the natural son
  of James V., was, at the time of the Reformation, Prior of St. Andrew's,
  although a secular person. The Earl of Kilmorey, who is impropriator of
  the tithes of St. Mary, Newry, is a lay abbot, or representative of the
  preceding abbots of a Cistertian Abbey which formerly existed in that
  town. His abbatial functions, however, are confined to convening
  ecclesiastical courts, and granting probates of wills, and licenses for
  marriages, subject only to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the
  Archbishop of Armagh. A remnant of the secularisation of ecclesiastical
  dignities has already been noticed in our pages (Vol. ii., pp. 447.
  500.), in the case of the late Duke of York, who was at the same time
  Commander-in-chief and Bishop of Osnaburg.]</p>

<h3>SIR BALTHAZAR GERBIER.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 375.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">J. Mt.</span> has great reason to
  congratulate himself on the possession of the singularly curious tract
  which he describes, and which gives an autobiography of this
  extraordinary adventurer. I am not aware of any other copy in any public
  or private collection. I have a 4to. tract in nineteen pages, evidently
  printed abroad, the title of which is&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">"Balthazar Gerbier, Knight,<br />
to<br />
All Men that love Truth."</p>

<p><!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>{305}</span></p>

  <p>This gives a very interesting life of him by himself, perfectly
  distinct from, and containing many particulars not given in the tract
  possessed by your correspondent, which also contains matter not in the
  above. I have likewise another tract, privately printed in Holland in
  English, French, and Dutch, in fifteen pages 12mo., the English title to
  which is&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">"A true Manifest,<br />
By S<sup>r</sup> B. Gerbier.<br />
Anno<br />
1653."</p>

  <p>In this, which gives some curious particulars as to "Mr. Hughe
  Peeters," and the book entitled <i>The Nonsuch Charles</i>, he refers to
  another "little manifest" published on the 2nd day of October, 1652,
  "that the world might take notice that he was not at all invested with
  any foreigne engagement." Of the tract so referred to, I regret to say no
  copy is known. None of the other three tracts appear to have been seen by
  Horace Walpole, who had collected a great number of Gerbier's pamphlets,
  and also the MS. next mentioned, which, at the Strawberry Hill sale, came
  together into my possession. The MS. contains the original appointments
  of Sir Balthazar to the offices he held while in England, a pedigree of
  his family beautifully emblazoned, and a large quantity of MS., prose and
  poetry, in his autograph; including a most extensive collection of
  projects and proposals, which seem to have been equally at the service of
  England or France. The best account we have of Gerbier is that which
  Horace Walpole has supplied in the <i>Anecdotes of Painting</i> (see
  <i>Works</i>, vol. iii. p. 189.); but his diplomatic negotiations, and
  his career as an artist and adventurer, never forgetting his academy at
  Whitefriars and Bethnal Green, would furnish matter for a very amusing
  volume. The general biography, however, to which he would be most
  appropriately remitted, and which is still a desideratum in literature,
  is that which is proposed by Dr. Johnson, in Chalmers's admirable
  parody:</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELS OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 519.; Vol. iii., p. 117.)</p>

  <p>Is not your correspondent <span class="sc">J. Me.</span> in error when
  he says the original travels of the Baron were written to ridicule Bruce?
  I think this will only apply to the second volume, or "Sequel," seeing
  that there exists an edition of <i>Gulliver Revived</i>, printed at
  Oxford, 1786, four years before Bruce published. <span class="sc">J.
  Me.</span> further remarks, that there was at one time reason to believe
  that James Graham was the author of the well-known book in question, but
  that circumstances have come to his knowledge altogether precluding the
  possibility that the author of <i>The Sabbath</i> and <i>The Travels of
  Baron Munchausen</i> are identical.</p>

  <p>To me it appears there were <i>two</i> of these James Grahams, and
  that from their being contemporaries, they are usually rolled into one. I
  have in my library a volume containing <i>Wallace, a Tragedy</i>,
  Edinburgh, 1799; and <i>Mary Stewart, Queen of Scots, an Historical
  Drama</i>, Edinburgh, 1801, which appears to have belonged to Mr. George
  Chalmers, upon the titles of which that gentleman has written, "by James
  Graham, Advocate, Edinburgh, son of T. Graham, a writer of reputation in
  Glasgow."</p>

  <p>From this one would think Mr. Chalmers had the author of <i>The
  Sabbath</i> in his eye: a conclusion, however, difficult to come to in
  the face of a critique which thus characterises the tragedy of
  <i>Wallace</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The play is not uninteresting, and the author has exhibited
  occasional proofs of poetical genius; but there are some passages in the
  piece that fall little short of blasphemy:"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>&mdash;a charge which, of course, could never apply to this "lovable"
  and subsequently <i>reverend</i> author of <i>The Sabbath</i>, a poem
  breathing the humblest piety, and published only five years after
  <i>Wallace</i>; consequently here is, in the author of the tragedy of
  <i>Wallace</i>, another James Graham at the service of <span
  class="sc">J. Me.</span>, to whom, if his other proofs are strong, the
  Baron may be assigned with more probability.</p>

  <p>I may add, taking it for granted that Chalmers was right in claiming
  these two plays for a James Graham, that there is the strongest
  corroborative proof of there being two of the name in the existence of
  <i>Mary Stewart, a Dramatic Poem</i>, the acknowledged performance of the
  author of <i>The Sabbath</i> (see his <i>Poems</i>, 2 vols. 1809), a
  production differing in title, and bearing no resemblance, I should
  think, to the first named.</p>

  <p>While upon the subject, and presuming that the tragedy of
  <i>Wallace</i> is known to <span class="sc">J. Me.</span>, I may take the
  opportunity to ask him, as he is <i>ayont the Tweed</i>, whether there is
  really any authority for the assertion contained in the Abbotsford
  Library Catalogue, and also in that of Constable's Library, sold in 1817,
  that of this anonymous tragedy of <i>Wallace</i> there were <i>only six
  copies printed</i>? Upon the face of mine there is nothing to indicate
  its rarity, it being an octavo, printed for A. Constable; but the
  remarkable book may be some other: your correspondents will, however, I
  dare say, be able to enlighten me.</p>

  statements that the author of <i>Munchausen</i> was a Mr.
  "M&mdash;&mdash;," and that he was a prisoner in France. Accident has
  within the last few days thrown in my way the very volume of the
  <i>Anecdotes</i> in which this is stated (vol. v., <i>Anecdotes of
  Captivity</i>, p. 103.); and I find that I was mistaken only in supposing
  "M&mdash;&mdash;'s" place of confinement to have been the Bastile,
  whereas the time is said to have been the Reign of Terror, and therefore
  of course the Bastile cannot have been the place.</p>

  <p><i>Tobacco in the East</i> (vol. ii., pp. 155. 231.).&mdash;M.&nbsp;D. asks

  respecting tobacco.</p>

  <p>Had A. C. M. recollected that tobacco (<i>Nicotiana</i>) is an
  American plant, he would hardly have asked whether "<i>tobacco</i> is the
  word in the original" of the tradition mentioned by Sale in his
  <i>Preliminary Discourse</i>, § 5. p. 123. (4to. ed. 1734.) Happily
  Reland, whom Sale quotes (<i>Dissert. Miscell.</i>, vol. ii. p. 280.),
  gives his authority, the learned orientalist, Dr. Sike, who received the
  Hadéth at Leghorn from Ibn Sáleh, a young Muselman. It says, in good
  Arabic, that in the latter days Moslims, undeserving of the name, shall
  drink hashish (hemp), and call it tabák; the last words, "<i>yukál lehn
  tabáku</i>," are no doubt a modern addition by those who had heard of
  <i>tambákó</i> (the Romaic <span title="tanpakon" class="grk"
  >&tau;&alpha;&nu;&pi;&#x1F71;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;</span>). As the use of
  hashish or <i>hashishah</i> (the herb), more completely <i>hashishata
  fukara</i>, i.e. Monk's Wort, a technical term for <i>hemp</i>, chewed as
  a narcotic by fakirs (monks), was not known till <span
  class="scac">A.H.</span> 608 (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1211), it
  could not be mentioned in the Koran unless Mohammed were, as Sale
  observes, "a prophet indeed." <i>Tabakak</i>, a plate, dish, or shelf, is
  now sometimes used by ignorant persons in the East for <i>tambákó</i>, of
  which a complete account is given in the <i>Karábádén</i>, or great
  treatise of Materia Medica in Persian. Of that work, there is a

  also employed in several other services, and died October 27, 1726. See
  <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>, vol. i. p. 691., edit. 1812. He is not
  noticed in Chalmers's <i>Biographical Dictionary</i>, though as the
  continuator of Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i> he unquestionably ought to
  have been. Watt gives a list (<i>Bib. Brit.</i>, vol. i. p. 880.) of his
  books and translations; but it is, as usual, very defective and
  erroneous. It does not include his translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, of
  <i>Dupin</i>, of <i>An Evening's Intrigue</i> (1707, 8vo.), and a great
  number of other works; and it ascribes to him the <i>History of the Wars

  it needs no great sagacity to discover, by Daniel Defoe, though Chalmers

  alarmed at the prospect of three thick folios, through which I have gone,
  I can assure him, with considerable interest, let me recommend to him
  <i>Theatrum Cometicum, Auctore Stanislao Lubienietz Lubieniecio
  Rolitsio</i>, Amst., in 2 vols. (but generally bound in three) folio. The
  first contains an immense correspondence, not merely with astronomers,
  but with poets, critics, physicians, and philosophers, to whom the
  indefatigable editor wrote for their opinions on the subject of comets.
  The second vol. gives a history of comets from the Deluge to 1665, and is
  a repository of everything bearing upon the subject. From this work Bayle
  derived his learning, when he wrote his most amusing work on comets.</p>

  <p><i>Solemnisation of Matrimony</i> (Vol. ii., p. 464.).&mdash;A.&nbsp;A.
  will find, from Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>, vol. ii. p. 135., that
  in feudal times a husband had the power of protecting his lands from the
  wife's claim to dower, by endowing her, <i>ad ostium Ecclesiæ</i>, with
  specific estates to the exclusion of others; or, if he had no lands at
  the time of the marriage, by an endowment in goods, chattels, or money.
  When special endowments were thus made, the husband, after affiance made
  and troth plighted, used to declare with what specific lands he meant to
  endow his wife ("<i>quod dotat eam de tali manerio</i>," &amp;c.); and
  therefore, in the old York ritual (<i>Seld. Ux. Hebr.</i> l. ii. c. 27.)
  there is at this part of the matrimonial service the following
  rubric&mdash;"<i>Sacerdos interroget dotem mulieris; et si terra ei in
  dotem detur, tunc dicatur psalmus iste</i>", &amp;c. When the wife was
  endowed <i>generally</i>, the husband seems to have said "with all my
  lands and tenements I thee endow," and then they all became liable to her
  dower. When he endowed her with personalty only, he used to say, "with
  all my worldly goods (or, as the Salisbury ritual has it, "with all my
  worldly chattels") I thee endow," which entitled the wife to her thirds,
  or <i>pars rationabilis</i>, of his personal estate, which is provided
  for by Magna Charta, cap. 26. The meaning, therefore, of the words
  noticed in A.&nbsp;A.'s Query, if they can be said to have any meaning in the
  present state of the law, is simply that the wife's dower is to be
  general, and not specific, or, in other words, that she is to have her
  <i>pars rationabilis</i> in <i>all</i> her husband's goods.</p>

  <p>"The well-known epitaph of the celebrated Countess of Pembroke, the

  <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>, preserved in the Lansdown Collection,
  British Museum, No. 777., and on this evidence may be fairly appropriated
  to him, particularly as it is known that he was a great favourite with

  <p>I shall be much obliged to anybody who will settle the point

  <p><i>The Hippopotamus</i> (Vol. iii., p. 181.).&mdash;Your correspondent

  example of the word <span title="hippopotamos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F31;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&#x1F79;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  cited from Lucian, a writer anterior both to Horapollo and Damascius. In
  the same page is a reference to the story of the wickedness of the
  hippopotamus in Plutarch; so that Horapollo and Damascius, doubtless,
  borrowed from a common source, or repeated a current fable, to be found
  in many writings then extant.</p>

  <p><i>Tu Autem</i> (Vol. iii., p. 265).&mdash;The words "Tu autem,
  Domine, miserere nostri," "But Thou, O Lord! have mercy upon us," were
  originally a form of prayer used by the preacher at the end of his
  discourse, as a supplication for pardon for any sinful pride or
  vainglory, into which he might have been betrayed in addressing his
  congregation. Hence the words "tu autem," as Pegge properly says, came to
  denote a hint to the reader to leave off.</p>

  <p>The custom is still in constant use among the members of the cathedral
  church of Durham. At the public dinners given by the canons, in what is
  there called "hospitality residence," one of the choristers comes in
  after dinner, dressed in his official costume, and, taking his station
  behind the canon in residence, reads, in the manner which is now well
  known as <i>intoning</i>, eight verses of the 119th Psalm, first saying,
  "Here beginneth the &mdash;&mdash; part of the 119th Psalm."</p>

  <p>When the eight verses are concluded, the canon turns round to the
  chorister, saying "tu autem," giving him a shilling; to which the
  chorister replies, "Domine miserere nostri," and retires.</p>

  <p>The explanation of the words, as originally employed, is given by
  Rupertus <i>De Divinis Officiis</i>, lib. i. c. xiv.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead"><span class="scac">DE "TU AUTEM DOMINE."</span></p>

  <p>"Quodque in fine dicit, 'Tu autem Domine miserere nostri,' hoc innuit,
  ne ipsum quidem bonum officium prædicandi sine alicujus vel levis culpæ
  pulvere possa pagi. Nam, ut ait B. Augustinus, 'Verbum prædicationis
  securiùs auditur quàm dicitur. Prædicator quippe cùm benè dicere se
  sentit, difficile nimis est ut non quantulumcunque spiritu elationis
  tangat; et quia quasi per terram ambulat et pedes ejus pulvere
  sordidantur, idcirco misericordiâ Dei indiget, ut in hâc parte lavetur,
  etiamsi mundus sit totus.'"</p>

  <p><i>Obeahism.&mdash;Ventriloquism</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 59.

  Obeahism is not only a rite, but a religion, or rather superstition, viz.
  <i>Serpent-worship</i>. <i>Modern Universal History</i>, fol. vol. vi. p.
  600.; 8vo. vol. xvi. p. 411.; which is indebted for its information to
  the works of De Marchais, Barbot, Atkyns, and Bosman: the last of which
  may be seen in Pinkerton's <i>Collection</i>, vol. xvi., and a review of
  it in <i>Acta Eruditor.</i>, Lips. 1705, p. 265., under the form of an
  "Essay on Guinea." In Astely's <i>Collection of Voyages</i>, there is an
  account compiled from every authority then known, and a very interesting
  description of the rites and ceremonies connected with this superstition.
  According to the same authors, the influence of the Obeist does not
  depend on the exercise of any art or natural magic, but on the
  apprehensions of evil infused into his victim's mind. See also Lewis's
  <i>Journal of a Residence among the Negroes in the West Indies</i>.</p>

  <p>The following references will furnish a reply at once to two Queries;
  to that here noticed, and to that on "Ventriloquism" (Vol. ii., p.
  88.).</p>

  <p>The name of the sacred serpent, which in the ancient language of
  Canaan was variously pronounced, was derived from "ob" (inflare), perhaps
  from his peculiarity of inflation when irritated. See Bryant's
  <i>Analysis</i>, vol. i.; Deane's <i>Worship of the Serpent</i>, p. 80.
  From a notion of the mysterious inflation produced by the presence of the
  divine spirit, those who had the spirit of Ob, or Python, received the
  names of Ob, or Pythia; according to the not unusual custom for the
  priest or priestess of any god to take the name of the deity they served.
  See Selden, <i>De Dis Syris</i>, Synt. 1. c. 2. It is a curious
  coincidence, that as the Witch of Endor is called "Oub," and the African
  sorceress "Obi," from the serpent-deity <i>Oub</i>, so the old English
  name of a witch, "hag," bears apparent relationship to the word
  <i>hak</i>, the ancient British name of a species of snake. In Yorkshire,
  according to Stukeley, they call snakes "hags" and "hag-worms," (Abury,
  p. 32.).</p>

  <p>In the Breton language, <i>Belech</i> is "Priest," and may similarly
  indicate a priest of Bel-the-Dragon.</p>

  <p>From the Hebrew <i>Ob</i>, the Greek <span title="ophis" class="grk"
  >&#x1F44;&phi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> was probably derived; for the same
  word, in Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek, which denotes "divination" denotes a
  "serpent." "Nachash,"<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> "ilahat,"<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> "<span title="oiônizesthai" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&#x1F30;&omega;&nu;&#x1F77;&zeta;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;</span>,"<a
  name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> have the same
  double signification as if the serpent were recognised as the grand
  inspirer of the heathen prophets. See Faber's <i>Horæ Mosaicæ</i>, vol.
  i. p. 98.</p>

  <p>The word "Ob" was translated by the LXX. <span title="engastrimuthos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F10;&gamma;&gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&iota;&mu;&#x1F7B;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  "a ventriloquist," in <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page310"></a>{310}</span>accommodation to the received opinions
  respecting the Pythian priestess. See the Notes to Creech's
  <i>Lucretius</i>, book v.; Jones's (of Nayland) <i>Physiolog.
  Disquis.</i> p. 290. The deception practised by the Witch of Endor, and
  by the damsel mentioned in Acts xvi. 16., was of this description. See
  Wierus de <i>Præstig. Dæmon.</i> p. 203.; and Reginald Scot's
  <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>, p. 148.</p>

  <p>The serpent, which with heathen mythologists had various acceptations
  (see Vossius, <i>Theologia Gent. et Physiologia Christ.</i>), was also
  understood as a natural symbol or hieroglyphic of the air. Can any of
  your learned correspondents furnish materials illustrative of this
  figurative relation between the serpent and the elements?</p>

  <p><i>Venwell or Venville</i> (Vol. iii., p. 38.).&mdash;<i>Venwell</i>
  or <i>Venville</i> appears to me to be a corruption of the word
  <i>fengfield</i>; and the meaning of it seems to be, that custom of
  delivering possession of land to a purchaser by cutting a piece of turf
  from the field bought, and delivering it into his hands.</p>

  <p>I well remember, when a boy, accompanying my father to receive
  possession of an outlying field, distant from the main estate which he
  had bought; the seller's agent, I think, came with us and cut a small
  piece of turf from the ground, and delivered it into my father's hands,
  saying (if I recollect right), "By this turf I deliver this field into
  your possession." By this means my father "<i>fenged</i>" (took) the
  "<i>field</i>" into his own hands, and became the legal proprietor of
  it.</p>

  <p class="author">P.</p>

  <p><i>Venville.</i>&mdash;The peat or black earth of Dartmoor is still
  called <i>ven</i> or <i>fen</i>. Is it not more probable that the
  adjoining parishes (or parts of them) are said to be in Venville or
  fengfield, from their being within the peat district, than that an
  abbreviation of a legal term, <i>fines villarum</i>&mdash;<i>fin.
  vil.</i>, should become naturalised among the peasantry, as is the case
  with the word Venville?</p>

  <p>The second part of the word seems akin to the Scottish <i>fail</i>, "a
  turf, or that clod covered with grass cut off from the rest of the
  sward." (Jamieson.)</p>

  orthography. The spelling of the legend on the sixpences and shillings
  was intentional, and with a meaning, being inscribed in an abridged
  form&mdash;<span class="scac">GEOR: III. D: G: BRITT: REX F:
  D:</span>&mdash;the reduplication of the <span class="scac">T</span> was
  designed, after classical precedent, to represent the plural
  <i>Britanniarum</i>, i.e., Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Hepworth Dixon, who is already favourably known as the author of a
  <i>Life of Howard</i>, has just published <i>William Penn, an Historical
  Biography</i>. It is unquestionably a book of considerable talent; and
  even those who may be most inclined to dissent from the <!-- Page 311
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>{311}</span>author's views
  of the political principles of the Quakers (and we suspect many of the
  Quakers themselves will be found among that number), will admit that in
  treating him not as a mere Quaker, as preceding biographers had been too
  much disposed to do, but as "a great English historical
  character&mdash;the champion of the Jury Laws&mdash;the joint leader,
  with Algernon Sidney, of the Commonwealth men&mdash;the royal councillor
  of 1684-8&mdash;the courageous defender of Free Thought&mdash;the founder
  of Pennsylvania"&mdash;Mr. Dixon has succeeded in the task which he had
  proposed to himself, namely, that of transforming William Penn "from a
  myth into a man." His vindication of this great man from what he
  designates "The Macaulay Charges" would not, however, have lost one iota
  of its efficiency, had it been couched in somewhat more measured
  terms.</p>

  <p>Mr. Murray announces <i>The Grenville Papers; being the Private
  Correspondence of Richard Grenville Earl Temple, his brother George
  Grenville, their Friends and Contemporaries</i>, as in the press. It will
  contain some letters from Junius, and Mr. Grenville's Diary, particularly
  during his premiership, from 1763 to 1765. The fifth and sixth volumes of
  Lord Mahon's <i>History of England from the Peace of Utrecht</i> are also
  at press.</p>

  <p>Lady Theresa Lewis is nearly ready with a work which cannot but be of
  great interest. It is entitled <i>Lives of the Friends and Contemporaries
  of Lord Chancellor Clarendon, illustrative of Portraits in his Gallery;
  with an Account of the Origin of the Collection; and a descriptive
  Catalogue of the Pictures</i>. It will form two volumes, and be
  accompanied by illustrative portraits.</p>

  <p>Mr. Colburn announces a new library edition of Miss Strickland's
  <i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>. Although revised and considerably
  augmented by new materials which have been placed at Miss Strickland's
  disposal since the appearance of the earlier impressions of her book,
  this edition is to be comprised in eight monthly volumes.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received</span>.&mdash;<i>The Buried City of
  the East: Nineveh.</i> A popular view of the discovery of the remains of
  the great city, compiled principally from Botta, and illustrated with
  numerous woodcuts, affords information enough, perhaps, for those who may
  be unable to consult the stirring narrative of Layard himself, but must
  send to his pages a great number of readers, in whom it can only serve to
  waken a lively interest in this great triumph of individual
  perseverance.&mdash;<i>The Iliad of Homer, literally translated, with
  explanatory Notes</i>, by T.&nbsp;A. Buckley, B.A., is the new volume of
  Bohn's <i>Classical Library</i>; and the Editor expresses his hopes "that
  it will be found to convey, more accurately than any which has preceded
  it, the words and thoughts of the original." The work has obviously been
  executed with great care; and the notes, though brief, are to the
  point.</p>
